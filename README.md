Knowing the type of rock, knowing the properties and characteristics is very important in the mining and energy industry, so this Dataset details the geochemical variations and compositions (SiO2, TiO2, Al2O3, Fe2O3, â€¦..)of different types of rock. The objective of this data set is focused on finding interesting characteristics and being able to find the type of rock given a series of properties. Using data mining method it is expected to be able to create a model that can identify the type of rock according to its properties and be able to find interesting correlations.
